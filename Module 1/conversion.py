# The program converts the speed from Kilometers/hr to Miles/per

# its a short and sweet code, the other way program would be
# ====== I tried writing the otherwise but doesn't work :(
 # mph = int(input("enter mile/h: "))
 # kph = 1.6 * mph
 # print("speed:", mph, "km/h = ", mph, "MPH")


kmh = int(input("Enter km/h: "))
mph =  0.6214 * kmh
print("Speed:", kmh, "KM/H = ", mph, "MPH")
